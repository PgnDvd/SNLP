Banana nut Odwalla bars are life.
like orange mango or mighty mango yumm Odwalla can't compare srry,thanks cody I was having a moment on the street there ppl giving me looks
Thanks for sharing Odwalla with a friend! We're happy to hear you're giving us high marks!
Pro: precise fractions. Con: just realized this Odwalla smoothie expired three days ago. 
Ate an Odwalla bar and it's hitting my stomach like a massive turd made out of my mouth, Because that will improve my situation
Waking up to a mini fridge full of Naked Juice and Odwalla is pretty great.
Don't settle for anything less than 100I'm so glad Odwalla makes a a protein juice that's vegan. I love the gritty texture of them.
Time to level up some 'Mechs with Odwalla, LIVE right now on NGNGtv!  #MWO
I can get just about a week out of a 64 oz jug of Odwalla carrot juice. I'm taking a swig every morning.
I need Odwalla orange juice in my life
Odwalla is soooo goooooooooooooood!
Just paid .39 for an Odwalla. Buying food at a ski resort is like sitting on a ski pole.
I cringe when I see people drinking Naked or Odwalla juices. Omg. Just come home will me. Like I will make you a smoothie. Plz.
I suppose in the spirit of the season I should be thankful for the food that awaits me at and just sit here and enjoy my Odwalla.
I want Odwalla 
WHICH REMINDS ME I saw something in Walmart called Odwalla and I??? is that where Odolwa's name came from because I hope it was
