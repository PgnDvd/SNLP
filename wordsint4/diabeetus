Hungry but not hungry on thanksgiving. Hate diabeetus. HATE.
I've got one word to describe the feasting I will partake in today: DIABEETUS.
I'm thankful for constant negativity and hatefulness. Also I'm thankful for diabeetus.
Last thanksgiving I weighed 320. Today I weight 254. I'm trying to break 300 today #Diabeetus
Anyway, stoats past, present and future; totes the stoats; Scrooge redeemed; Thanksmas saved; turkey; Tiny Tim; diabeetus every one.
