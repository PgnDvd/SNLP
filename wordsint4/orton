IIt'd be nice if Orton made a return right now #Raw
Everyone complains about Orton but once he's gone everyone wants him back pic.twitter.com/OXKZ77o9Jn
During a show that has lacked much spark. An Orton return at the close? Could just save the show from being labelled as lacklustre. #RAW

I hope Cena loses his title shot at TLC and we get Orton vs Brock at the rumble. #WWE #RAW
I salute you, Kyle Orton. Well done. 
Pot Roast on Orton: He can manage the game, he’s a veteran, but we’ll get pressure on him like we do most quarterbacks. #Broncos
Cena loses at TLC, he loses his number one contendership. And that's where Randy Orton will appear to screw Rollins. You're welcome. #RAW
