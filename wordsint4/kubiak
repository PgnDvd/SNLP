Ravens fans.. These 5 loses may be a blessing in disguise.. Enough to keep Kubiak from getting a HC job.
Few game notes:,,1) Whatever Gary Kubiak did during the bye to fix the offense is working. Flacco looks comfortable again.

Again, correct answer was Morton, Elway, Kubiak, Plummer, Manning. #Broncos
One thing that is obvious coming outta the bye week- Joe Flaccoâ€™s improved pocket awareness! Kubiak/Dennison I bet showed him film of it!
Kubiak + running backs = happy fantasy owners #justinforsett
Gary Kubiak should grab a 50-year-old man, turn him into a Pro Bowl running back next year, just prove he can.
That Gary Kubiak offense sure is rolling...
Forsett has 22 carries for 182 yards and 2 TDs. Ravens have rushed for 216 yards. Saints are inept on defense but Kubiak calling great game.
That Gary Kubiak play sheet is why pro coaches should often avoid Key to college offensive success is to be simple & efficient
Kubiak with the entire Madden playbook on one sheet. He's just mad he couldn't draw the diagrams too.
