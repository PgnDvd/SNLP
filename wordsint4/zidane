Zidane is the best ever don't care what anybody says
Ronaldinho was the best in the world in 06, followed by zidane. they gave cannavaro the ballon dor cause he was winning World Cup captain
asIMO Henry should’ve of won World Best player in 03, he was just unlucky he had Zidane ahead of him in 03 and Ronaldinho ahead in 04
Zidane isn't a muslim? Is he? I know he was raised a muslim but he stopped practisin... — Did he whatsapp you this? 
Henry is a #Legend, He is a Role Model, He is Respected. Henry will never be forgotten just like Pele, Maradona, Zidane etc. 1/2

Buffon won the WC, saved that deluxe Zidane header, but somehow Neuer gets a Ballon d'Or nom, because he dey do diving header for midfield.
How can I explain poetry, if you have never seen Zidane play? 
Isn't Fellaini playing like Zidane & Smalling like S.Ramos in first half? Hahaha #JustSaying
Turns out Fellaini was the new Zidane all along but he just wanted rid of Moyes like the rest of the us.
Fellaini or Zidane? Can't tell a difference at the moment.
