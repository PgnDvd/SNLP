//#StandUpForOCs As a wannabe writer, RPing OCs is a very efficient way to develop characters. No matter what you do there will be someone--
//OCs are the most amazing and the best part of rping! They're usually very well done and creative! Don't hate on them! #StandUpForOCs
// 3 Natsu's is now RPing meh. 
|| When I started watching Sherlock I made the promise of never RPing as him. He looks like the most complicated character to RP to me. --
