INSANITY AT HOFSTRA!!! Sayville fumbles deep in Lawrence territory, Melik Mavruk returns it 80 yds for a TD! Lawrence takes the lead! #ndlic
Sometimes I think about how many rings I'd have if I played football for Sayville
Do yourself a favor & watch this one. Stunning finish: Game replay: Lawrence 40, Sayville 35 - via @msg_varsity
To all those on Long Island, we've been invited to Sayville's Miracle on Main Street today.  We'll be showcasing... 
Sayville killed it in sales. Exceeded goal in RCs. Still left a great zone & i came home to a plate of leftovers. #goodnight
Sayville QB Jack Coan can hold head high 
One of most dramatic endings in LIC history, Lawrence's returns fumble 82 yds for GW TD over Sayville pic.twitter.com/snvQCNJv9X

Lawrence wins the Long Island Class III football championship, topping Sayville 40-35. #NDLIC pic.twitter.com/l1Z5dlEU1B
Sayville didn't take enough adderal I guess
Sayville football you guys put up a great fight,  Joe would be proud #56
Still so proud of Sayville win or lose were still the best and there's nothing to regret. You played with your hearts and filled with pride
Sayville with the ultimate screw up! They toss away the Long Island Championship. Ahhhh it's a goooood day
LIC got my girl (former Sayville lacrosse icon) looking like a prisoner. #NDLIC pic.twitter.com/7c4LauAgEb
Sayville clinging to a 21-20 lead as a rollicking (yeah, I said rollicking) first half comes to an end. Ya want some more? #NDLIC
