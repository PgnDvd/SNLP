I liked a playlist â€¦ Let's Play Okamiden (DS)
we don't talk about okamiden
You could *technically* call Okami a series since Okamiden is a thing.
I feel like blocking He's a poor mans bastard at being an okamiden
Oh dear, I even had to make a vent comic about Okamiden.  
The road of Okamiden has been long and broken, but it has finally come to an end. Now for the final task. 
Yeah, same. The last one I watched all the way through was Okamiden.
is that because of okamiden or
can I ask why the dislike for okamiden?
OKAY i was in the middle of a boss battle in okamiden but i finished that so now its time to fire emblem
While waiting for Zelda U, if you need that fix, pick up Okami for the PS2, PS3 or Wii. It's one of the best ever. Ignore Okamiden.
also BAE I DOWNLOADED OKAMIDEN YAS
IsYou know its been three fucking years and I still can't finish my okamiden replay. ,Fuck that game
i keep getting stuck in the same spot in okamiden
so what games do you play on your 3ds then? except for okamiden or how its named :p
God, I can only play Okamiden for 10 or 20 minutes, before having to put it down out of sheer disgust that it's not the original Okami. </3
 okami is god tier / okamiden  is forced
was playing okamiden this week and all i can think of is shunao's ammys theyre so fuckin' cute
