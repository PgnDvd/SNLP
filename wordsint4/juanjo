#ReinaDeCorazones I love it,, but who killed this lady?? Ohh God more mysteries. ... is it Juanjo? Greta? Or Who??????
I'm very lost watching this episode is very confusing! First I thought Reina got shot n now Juanjo got crazy! ¿Q novela?
And I actually thought Juanjo was a good guy.  #ReinaDeCorazones
You know what the saddest part is? Juanjo was my favorite! I thought he was perfect from Day 1 but HE'S actually CRAZY  #ReinaDeCorazones
Awh Javier is crying cause he really loved Juanjo #ReinaDeCorazones
Messi has lost, in the last few years: Pep, Abidal, Juanjo Brau, Tito and one of his best friends, Topo Lopez. ,,SURELY his issue is money!
