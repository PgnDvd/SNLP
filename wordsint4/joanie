I don't know what I did to deserve to meet such an amazing person like Joanie, I can never thank the boys enough for making it possible
There is a lot about that reminds me of Joan Benoit Samuelson. Now, like Joanie,â€¦ 
if you think Harry's knock knocks are bad you should hear Joanie's knock knock jokes, they made me realise how funny Harry's jokes are
I'm also thankful for my amazing friends over here including Skylar agustina Ashley Joanie dayra Shay Su aparna gillian and val  :-)
