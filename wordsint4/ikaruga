Quiero Ikaruga, Skyrim, Goat Simulator, Saints Row 4, Shadow Warrior, Ether Vapor Remaster y Payday 2 ;_;
I didn't know Ikaruga was on PC
Thosedo you think it's possible to make a music/puzzle 2d shooter similar to radiant silvergun/ikaruga? Ithem
Got a new phone! first apps I get? All Cave shooters! #SHUMP addiction is real SON!!!! Is Ikaruga mobile too?
Maybe we'll run into the HeroIkaruga seems awesome, but I haven't played it before. I did once play a lot of NOIS2sa which is incredible bullethell shooter.
  Thinking of getting my wife a figure of Ikaruga from Senran Kagura for Christmas since she's her favorite Senra...
When I play with Ikaruga in SV I just don't understand why she isn't the main character.
… loud audible fart , really Ikaruga over radiant silvergun? also no lords of thunder ,axelay or soldier blade?

To play #Ikaruga: Rotate a 30″ display. Add fightstick to finish the feeling. It’s like the arcade! Epic awesomeness! pic.twitter.com/Ed55xdFZMB
Shmup Wednesdays. Touhou, Ikaruga, Crimzon Clover, possibly more. 
5,667 games are on sale on Steam right now.  But not Ikaruga.
Happy Japanese games like Trails in the Sky and Ikaruga are on Steam.,,Sad they don't appear to have been given a general discount at all.

For some reason the price of #Ikaruga on #GameCube in Japan really holds its value. Still sells for + or so iirc. pic.twitter.com/SpEQHAQDJ5
