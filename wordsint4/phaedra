it was all a game to Phaedra & Apollo bc when Kenya tried talking to Phaedra in Savannah Phaedra ignored her
Phaedra knew Apollo was lying bc any other wife would have took over that reunion ignored Andy & started asking ?s
“when you're being dramatic for humorous effect and someone says wowI don't think enough people understand, Phaedra is trying to keep HERSELF out of prison. Don't get it twisted. It's not about Apollo. #RHOA
because it was EVIDENT to everyone, especially Phaedra that Apollo was very attracted to Kenya. Phaedra=Jealous
Moving to Tree Hill North Carolina that's where I belong bye @Phaedra_Moore5
how you've tried to apologize and talk to Phaedra several times and she ignored you but continued spreading lies and rumors
iI knew Phaedra wouldn't apologize after all that southern belle crap/Im sure more will spill about her also #RHOA
Kenya's emotional outburst was over the top. Please. And that part abt Phaedra/Apollo/air mattress was very interesting!
I am not here for Phaedra's scenes either, if she's just gonna show her kids all the time.  I could watch Nick Jr for that.,#RHOA

Apollo sure loves to trash Phaedra, regardless how he feel about her he needs to remember that she’s the mother of his kids #RHOA
I'm so over & her crocodile tears. This is the same woman who threatened a pregnant Phaedra & said Apollo sexted her. Bye #RHOA
Ayden is just the cutest. I love that kid.  He has more sense than a lot of adults.  Phaedra is doing an excellent job in raising him #RHOA
