not even peace is owed to you. you've got to commit to creating the space for that.
Make peace with your past so it won't screw up your present.
Who besides God can give you peace? Has the world ever been able to satisfy your heart?
Peace is not the absence of affliction, but the presence of God.
Peace on the outside comes from knowing God on the inside.
I wish people didn't think silence was awkward, just enjoy it. Not every space has to be filled with words. Enjoy the peace.
Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy, and serenity... just be awake,,~Thich N.Hanh pic.twitter.com/IsZWcPkneb
I know it's corny but the intangible things we search for like love, peace and happiness are in the mirror; not people, places or things.
