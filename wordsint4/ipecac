Just in case all the little kids in your family get together to put on a show, keep an emergency dose of ipecac handy at all times.
Why do I always get Mom's Eye on the same run as Ipecac? Somebody remind me never to get those together, it's the worst thing.
Thanksgiving Cleanse Option #2: Ipecac shot, celery stalk, ipecac shot, celery stalk
