Today in boxing history 1973: Bob Foster W 15 Pierre Fourie. Retains World LHW Title & Hall of Famer Eusebio Pedroza makes pro debut
If you're going to compare Henry to someone compare him to Eusebio, Pele, Romario, Van Basten, R9, no striker in this generation comes close
Zubi, Eusebio et are anti Cruyff. Stooges that fit the bill. @BumperGraham
Go on and vote for Roly and Eusebio. Offensive and defensive players of the week.,
Tbh I really don't want Lucho to be fired or to leave this summer because I'm pretty confident that this board could hire Eusebio instead.
If Barca B get relegated will burn Eusebio alive
People actually believed Eusebio is a good coach after last season's results. He's absolutely horrible
I have a gift for Eusebio pic.twitter.com/nvVRAYaeeh
If Barça B get relegated with talented kids like Samper, Adama, Grimaldo and Halilovic, Eusebio better leaves before someone murders him...
All over: Barça B 1-2 Albacete. Eusebio's boys are slipping closer and closer to the bottom four.
They gave Eusebio a new deal. But with the players he has Barça B should be in the top-8 at least. They are now 15th(!)..
I hope Eusebio resigns after the game. #EusebioDimissió
Eusebio still not getting any praise again on my TL.,,How he got a new deal is beyond me.
And another one, Barcelona B 1-2 down against Albacete, who are bottom of the Segunda Division. Poor. Eusebio isn't the man for the job.
Barcelona B haven't won in thier last 6 games. (over a month already) Not going so well with Eusebio's team.
O original (não me recordo o nome), Eusebio Resende como stand-by e há pouco o Julio Oliveira assumiu.
Please join us in praying for our local priests. Today we pray for Rev. Eusebio Silva and Rev. Bruce Collard.
We have lost Eusebio already, let's wish King Pele a speedy recovery. @Veli_Mbuli
Losing Eusebio and potentially Pele in the same year, whilst Phil Thompson continues to live is just wrong.
