Thrice's Vheissu album is something that is etched into my brain forever.
I want to be in a good post hardcore band like pre Vheissu Thrice
I do think that Vheissu is Thrice's most significant album...what comes next sounds a lot more like Vheissu than TAITA. #thricemarathon
TAITA is more visceral, but Vheissu is leaps and bounds more musically polished and mature. #thricemarathon
Well, this never used to be one of my favorite Vheissu songs, but it might be now. So much energy! #thricemarathon
I love the lyrics of TAITA, but I think I'd forgotten how vivid Dustin's lyrics are on Vheissu. Another level of good. #thricemarathon
This is my number 1 album of Thrice and the first one I got started on! #Vheissu #thricemarathon
Vheissu has the best album artwork of all time
Remember the power of France, Vheissu
Enrq ahora tiene SW4G, Vheissu ha sido devorado por su creatividad, Truki ahora es del Rvbivs gvng; De namule no hablo >
Donde están Enrq, vheissu, trukitrake, namule, chimechu, cjt, vater, y LA PUTA LOCA ESA QUE estaba siempre en el foro de Lady Gaga
I'm listening to Vheissu at the moment! I think I'm going to spoil myself and buy Alchemy Index I-IV today
Current contents of my car- 2 empty four lokos, 1 vuvuzela, 's ski mask, 1 scratched up bootleg of Thrice's Vheissu, and 
Do I get Thrice's Vheissu on vinyl or nah?
Vheissu by thrice is such an incredible album pic.twitter.com/Oknns6hHMH
Thrice - Vheissu | Reissue Alternate Artwork w/ Embossed Cover 2x LP Clear /300 | Obscure… 
automatic respect if you love Vheissu and know who Thomas Pynchon is …
