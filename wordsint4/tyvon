Heart to Hearts w/ Tyvon always makes me feel better 
Tyvon Branch has gotta go. Not nearly worth what we're paying him. Landon Collins (SS-Alabama) would fit (after trading back)
Will someone please give me the update on tyvon?  I'm praying for you brother
My prayers still haven't stopped! I love you Tyvon with all my heart! God's got a plan for you, the fight is not over yet!
