¡VIVA FORWOOD!,
so far on tvd all i know is that i ship steferine, stelena, forwood, rebekah x stefan, i hate klaus and damon and stelena is pure pain
Too many forwood scenes are being used for liv and tyler   …
2 Forwood scenes....,1.)We'll find another way,Liv=Until we find a way,2.)And then the cuddle scene oc
yeah same for me, I hate how they copied a Forwood scene into a Parkwood one in last ep
RT for Forwood,FAV for Parkwood,I just want to see
Forwood has to be endgame. :/ RT : me too! :( my poor heart!! I hate that!
I refuse to check forwood scenes it'll just anger me which would result in me tweeting julie and telling her i hate her lol
Perfect now I am in a #Forwood spiral ... watching fanvids like there is no tomorrow :(
I just had #Forwood war flashbacks and I imagined the writers doing the same with #Olicity in 309 *___*
