...OPERATION bigger averages,REST NOT!!! ,credit: Fellow Khilo Ghadafi
after we heard the innocence judgment Ex Egypt president Mobarek had today, Thanks to those who killed Ghadafi once they captured him.
The Libyan Revolution is a total mess. Under Ghadafi they at least had a country. After the Revolution they have banditry.
