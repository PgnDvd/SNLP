{I lean my head over to nuzzle neck, breathing him in} I wouldn't have let you starve, pet. I promised.
#imagine Michael wraps his arms around you and you nuzzle your head in the crook of his neck, he plays with your hair and hums to you
I JUST WANT TO PLAY WITH HARRYS HAIR AND PUT IN A BUN AND CUDDLE WITH HIM AND NUZZLE MY FACE IN THE CROOK OF HIS NECK WHILE HE RUBS MY BACK
FL: Sid and Nuzzle are two easygoing teddy bears, er, brothers, who are irresistibly cute. Help them land in a home: 
harry is so cute and precious everything about him makes me want to hug him and nuzzle my face into his chest and kiss his nose
