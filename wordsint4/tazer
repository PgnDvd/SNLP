I will pay you to let me tazer you
Someone let me tazer them
So tied man , where Ya tazer at? 
// I miss you  you're a cool guy & I h8 your tazer 
Who in they right mind bring tazer and mace and don't use it
if the man is within 7 yrds of you, the tazer and the gun are worthless to you.
Pretty sure my next cat will be a ginger cat named Kaner, and he will constantly annoy and harass Tazer. As it should be.
in a split sec, after wrestling for my gun,let me switch to tazer to subdue this, surely, gentle giant~Off. Wilson

Hey rookie, you killed a 12 year old. Tazer? A tazer would immobilize, then you can approach. Where are your alternate non-deadly tools? wtf
I'm holding a free open lecture in HowYou have a Tazer, baton, and cuffs at your disposal so why would you resort to a pistol? 
1. He could of used a tazer ,,2. 1 or 2 shots would have worked, 6 shots? He was trying to kill him.
Aye let's be real even if Mike Brown attacked him he could've easily shot him with the Tazer Gun rather than use deadly force
I'm not belittling police. I'm just saying Wilson had mace, a tazer, or his own strength that could be used to detain someone, not kill them
