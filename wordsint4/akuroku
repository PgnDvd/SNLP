axel exploded himself bc of akuroku he didnt want to be a part of the system anymore he had to die
any song ever about dysfunctional relationships is about akuroku
Ellie will die. does Ellie ship akuroku. do u Ellie
i could actually ship yuriluke and i would still win bc i dont ship akuroku
//AkuRoku is filled with a very clingy axel and a very tsundere Roxas.
i feel like avoiding akuroku until kh3 is the only thing i can do to keep myself sane and not peel the skin off my face
update: i couldn't find any good akuroku fics r.i.p. me
This was even better than that sh*tty movie … @akuroku_
