Blunts and Panera bread with Payton soon, so excited 
Report: Sean Payton and Rob Ryan aren't getting along, which means one of them's likely getting gone

ForgivenessPayton Bertermann is one of the most genuine people that I've had the pleasure to become close to. I'm so thankful for her!
Love the scene with Charlie and President Payton. They can really carry on a dialog.  #StateofAffairs
Ray and David being dismissed by President Payton was awesome. #StateofAffairs
