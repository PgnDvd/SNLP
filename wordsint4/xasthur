Sick I just bought myself a xasthur and a darkthrone patch on eBay
Sitting in my room alone listening to Xasthur is kinda depressing but like in a cool way.
I'll never support Xasthur by buying his music even though its sweet

It's 6 am.  I'm still awake and listening to Xasthur.  
There's nothing I love more than vacuuming the house while listening to Xasthur. Tiger stripes fer dayz
Composing music for the game. It started off relatively respectably but now it sounds like Xasthur collaborating with Penderecki.
I love Xasthur but he will never be as good as Leviathan
