I want a new Ivalice based Final Fantasy game in general. :(
i hate ivalice, i say, as i waste so many hours on ivalice games
a very real display of this painful existence. for all the matsuno ivalice games, really.
Can't stop thinking about Ivalice. Listen to that chanting in the Vagrant Story soundtrack.

What would YOU love about living in Ivalice? (Circa FFTA/2) â€¦
I'm coming to the end of the Limestone Quarry on Vagrant. Ivalice is the best world.
Don't mind me, just getting Ivalice'd up to the eyeballs ^^~ pic.twitter.com/Td78qHuDX4

we're bringing Guard Cancel back to the Ivalice.
Then my name does reach outside of Ivalice!  How pleasant.  I'm a Sky Pirate.
