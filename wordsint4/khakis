I miss the times when Matt would just wear simple pants like khakis and a t shirt tbh
When guys wear khakis' and vans.
Non unis consist of ,A) sweats n big sweater,B) khakis n flannel
Guys that wear khakis and button ups are a blessing 
It's Monday. I am wearing khakis. They are snug due to over-indulgence. #JakeReport

Wouldnt be surprised if some girls wore a wig, khakis, and a polo and went to enroll in DLS.
And all girls dress the same? We see you all in your khakis pic.twitter.com/97sJ5ZriR1
Hey you should come out to the Eastwood Culver's because softball girls look really good in khakis 
tats, spacers, khakis, beanies and baggy t's/sweaters is probably the hottest thing ever
Sweaters and khakis on guys will always be my favorite.
