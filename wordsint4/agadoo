.my favourite haiku was always:,,Agadoo, doo, doo,Push pineapple, shake the tree,Agadoo, doo, doo
Is that Giorgio Moroder song a joke? It sounds like an 8 year old tried to recreate Agadoo on Garage Band
In corruption terms, that's like outlining a thesis concerning Beethoven's influence on Black Lace's Agadoo ...
I just had an email from a socialmr and Mrs Agadoo ! pic.twitter.com/V9fdkFmQeE
I’ve been inspired. Someone should sing Immigrant Song on next week’s #xfactor. Or possibly Agadoo.
I really hope the stellar second song of Andrea Faustini is a power ballad version of Agadoo including a crunching key change. #xfactor
I'm guessing Sam Smith won't be picking Agadoo for Andrea #xfactor
Deciding what to have as first dance at my wedding next year. I'm thinking either Agadoo or Chopsticks.
TONIGHT SATURDAY 29TH AT PENNINGTONS OCTAGON START YOUR CHRISTMAS PARTY EARLY WITH MR AGADOO DENE MICHAEL AND... 
DJing in front of 2.5million people? No bother. Bit of Agadoo and you're away. #ChattyMan
heard it's mostly novelty songs like Agadoo
Agadoo, but about The Babadook.
So tired I can't bear it.,Go to bed... ,Agadoo starts playing in my mind.,I'm pushing pineapples and grinding coffee  . But not sleeping
My 10 year old went to her first disco tonight.  Now I want to go back to my first in 1984.  I stunned them with my Agadoo that night :)
I usually listen to music every day. When I was away, hardly listened to any. This resulted in my brain torturing me with an Agadoo earworm
I find that singing Agadoo at the top of your voice will generally get you to the front of the line ar Costa Coffee
Thank you Monday night dynamos for two storming classes tonight! Agadoo, freestyling and planks front, side and... 
Have villa scored any other goals except boot it upfield for agadoo or whatever his bloody name is to chase and get lucky now and again

On days like this: Agadoo. Agadoo forever.
