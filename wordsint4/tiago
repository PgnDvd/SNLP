The #Spurs have 6 guys in double figures w no Tony,Tim,Tiago or Patty.Who ever thought that would happen,even against Philly. #SpursNation 
Spurs Tim Duncan (rest), Tony Parker  (bruised ribs) & Tiago Splitter (tightness, right calf) are out for tonight’s game at Philadelphia.
But if the Spurs can continue to rest Tiago through these first months, should go a LONG way with Tiago’s health come important time.
Tiago drama queen
Oh wait now I’m just sad and scared about Tiago.,,:(

When Tiago Splitter and Patty Mills eventually return, Diaw will likely return to the second unit to help some of the bench production.
