Now Playing: Ayane / KakuseiThe ninja pre-order costume pack looks really good. Especially Kasumi, Ayane and Hayate's costume. #DOA5LR
Also, after the set, a man introduced himself and told me he writes a lot of fan fiction for Kasumi and Ayane from DoA.,I didn't laugh!

NG's weird. Ryu's a badass, yes, but literally ALL the female characters are AMAZING. Rachel, Ayane, Momiji, Alma, THEY'RE ALL BADASS.
Well I just heard Team Ninja WERE working on a seperate game for Kasumi and Ayane but dropped it. WHY?!?!?!
